<h1>Comparative Study of Bio-Inspired Algorithm for Feature Selection in Instrusion Detection System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The study involves the use of bio-inspired algorithms Bio-inspired algorithms (Bee Colony (BC) and Fish Swarm (FS)). The feature selection of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which will solve the problem associated with highly dimensional network traffic data that tends to impair IDS performance. Based on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, the study proposes and applies BC and FS algorithms to identify the optimal subsets of features. These subsets are subsequently fed into the IDS models that are developed based on Random Forest classifier. Performance of the models is thoroughly tested using essential indicators of classification such as the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, and the results averaged across ten conducted experiments to acquire statistical confidence. Visuals like confusion matrix, ROC curves and convergence plots are used to understand the behaviour of an algorithm and model decision boundaries. The results identified that both algorithms, namely, BC and FS, significantly enhance the performance of detection whereby the
accuracy rate of BC is a bit higher, and the feature diversity of FS is greater. Moreover, there is a test of statistical significance of observed differences. Comparative evaluation of the result has concluded that the bio-inspired feature selection is not only increasing accuracy and robustness to IDS, but also saves computational overhead, giving birth to more effective and adaptive cybersecurity systems in practical circumstances.
